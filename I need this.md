# Information Needed for Antigravity (Bughunter-CFD)

I am currently analyzing the repository to resolve the issues you mentioned. However, I am unable to find several critical files and folders you referred to. To proceed with fixing the "dead system" and implementing the "Gemini 10" grade autonomous auditor, I need the following:

### 1. Missing Documents & Folders
- **`realme.md`**: You mentioned this file is on the root, but I cannot see it.
- **`doc4u` folder**: I cannot find this folder in the current directory or branches.
- **`.env` files**: I need to see the configuration for your API keys and environment.
- **`Web:Doc`**: You mentioned this as a source of documentation.

### 2. Existing "Bughunter-CFD" Code
You mentioned that the system "was finding before but not now." Currently, the repository only appears to contain the "Web3 Skills Learning Platform" (a skills tracker). I am missing:
- **Auditing Logic**: Code that interacts with Slither, Mythril, or other security tools.
- **Gemini Client**: The `geminiClient.ts` or similar file you mentioned.
- **Prisma Schema**: The `schema.prisma` file if it exists.
- **Admin Page Logic**: The existing `/notadmin` or similar admin page code.

### 3. Environment Details
- Where are the security tools (Slither, Mythril) installed?
- How is the application currently running? (Local, Docker, etc.)

Please provide these files or point me to where they are located. Once I have this information, I will be able to:
1. Fix the "Error 429" issues using the Virtual Rate Limiter strategy.
2. Implement the "Infinite Audit" engine.
3. Set up the Agentic Ensemble (Hunter-Advocate-Judge).
4. Evolve the Admin Control Panel.

I am ready to act as **Antigravity** and fix everything once I have the source code of the system that is currently "dead."
